# tox-external-wheels

Use externally created wheels with Tox

Features
--------

* The ability to define external wheel files to tests in the tox config (example `tox.ini` file):
```ini
[tox]
envlist = py-{a,b,c}
[testenv]
external_wheels =
    a: {toxinidir}/dist/*py27*.whl
    b: {toxinidir}/dist/*py37*.whl
commands =
    a,b: pytest test
    c: pip list
```

Or defined in a command line argument

```shell script
tox -e 'py-{a,b,c}' --external_wheels 'a:{toxinidir}/dist/*py27*.whl;b:{toxinidir}/dist/*py37*.whl'
```

**Note**: In this case `py-c` falls back to installing from source.

* The ability to define an external command to build wheel(s) with (example `tox.ini` file):
```ini
[tox]
envlist = py-{a,b,c}
[testenv]
external_build=
    ./prepare_build.sh
    ./build.sh
external_wheels =
    {toxinidir}/dist/*.whl
commands =
    a,b: pytest test
    c: pip list
```

Or defined in a command line argument
```shell script
tox -e 'py-{a,b,c}' --external_build './build.sh'
```

**Note**: if command exits with non-zero return code, error will be reported and exception will be raised.
